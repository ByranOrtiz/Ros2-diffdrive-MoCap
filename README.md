# Ros2-diffdrive-MoCap

This project implements control and monitoring of Pololu differential drive robots using ROS 2, with micro-ROS running on an ESP32 for embedded communication, and motion capture (MoCap) integration for precise localization and tracking.
Developed for the Robotat Laboratory at Universidad del Valle de Guatemala, this repository contains the necessary ROS 2 packages, micro-ROS firmware, configurations, and launch files to interface with the motion capture system, send velocity commands, and monitor robot states in real time.

Key features:

ROS 2-based architecture for differential drive robot control

micro-ROS firmware for ESP32-based embedded communication

Integration with motion capture for accurate position feedback

Real-time monitoring of robot states and trajectories

Designed for the Pololu 3pi+ and similar differential drive platforms

Modular and extensible for research and teaching applications
